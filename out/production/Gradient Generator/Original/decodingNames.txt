First character is the red colours function as the row increases
Second character is the red colours function as the column increases
Third character is the green colours function as the row increases
Forth character is the green colours function as the column increases
Fifth character is the blue colours function as the row increases
Sixth character is the blue colours function as the column increases
If the function is a constant then instead of a character a 3 digit number representing the constant is added instead

Table of characters:
I              - Increasing linearly (0.0 -> 1.0)
S              - Varying according to SIN
D              - Decreasing linearly (1.0 -> 0.0)
N              - None (Unaffected)
C              - Varying according to COS

Eg.
N100DN102102.png
Equals
Red constantly 100 throughout
Green decreasing as you go down the image (top to bottom) and unaffected as you go across (left to right)
Blue is constantly 102 throughout

If an image has 2 different numbers for it's row and column of a particular colour then those colours are averaged @@@ NOT YET IMPLEMENTED

A hashtag then a number at the end is used for duplicates so for example N100DN102102#2 means that this file is the second duplicate (or 3rd actual) file which
is identical to this one
